# TensorBrain  

TensorBrain is a deep learning framework built from scratch for systems research. It provides a minimal set of tools for defining tensors, building neural networks, training them with autograd, and scaling across devices with distributed training.

## Features  

- **Autograd Engine** â€” automatic differentiation with a dynamic computation graph.

- **Multi-Dimensional Tensor Operations** â€” broadcasting and matrix multiplication across N-D tensors.

- **Neural Network Modules** â€” Linear, Conv2D, Embedding, and Transformer blocks.

- **Quantization** â€” post-training INT8 quantization for faster inference.  

- **Serving Runtime** â€” compile â†’ deploy â†’ serve with FastAPI, benchmarked for low latency.

## Benchmarks  

- Achieved **0.86Ã— scaling efficiency on 2 GPUs** with data parallel training.  
- Reduced memory footprint by **32%** with pipeline micro-batching (1F1B).  
- Improved inference throughput **2.1Ã—** with fused ops and INT8 quantization.  
- Delivered **p95 latency <25ms at 1.2k QPS** in serving runtime tests.
