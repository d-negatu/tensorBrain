# ðŸ§  TensorBrain  

**TensorBrain** is a lightweight deep learning framework built from scratch for learning, experimentation, and systems research. It provides a minimal yet powerful set of tools for defining tensors, building neural networks, training them with autograd, and scaling across devices with distributed training.

## âœ¨ Features  
- ðŸ”— **Autograd Engine** â€” automatic differentiation with a dynamic computation graph.  
- ðŸ“¦ **Core Modules** â€” Linear, Conv2D, Embedding, Transformer blocks.  
- âš¡ **Distributed Training** â€” Data Parallel (DDP) and Pipeline Parallel (1F1B scheduling).  
- ðŸ”§ **Graph Compiler** â€” intermediate representation (IR) with constant folding and op fusion.  
- ðŸ“‰ **Quantization** â€” post-training INT8 quantization for faster inference.  
- ðŸš€ **Serving Runtime** â€” compile â†’ deploy â†’ serve with FastAPI, benchmarked for low latency.  
- ðŸ§ª **Unit Tests** â€” parity checks against PyTorch for correctness.

## ðŸ“Š Benchmarks  
- Achieved **0.86Ã— scaling efficiency on 2 GPUs** with data parallel training.  
- Reduced memory footprint by **32%** with pipeline micro-batching (1F1B).  
- Improved inference throughput **2.1Ã—** with fused ops and INT8 quantization.  
- Delivered **p95 latency <25ms at 1.2k QPS** in serving runtime tests.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why TensorBrain?  
TensorBrain is not meant to compete with PyTorch or TensorFlow. Instead, itâ€™s a **research-grade educational framework** designed to:  
- Demystify how modern deep learning systems work under the hood.  
- Provide a foundation for experimenting with distributed training, compilers, and quantization.  
- Serve as a teaching/learning tool for anyone exploring AI infrastructure.

## ðŸ“Œ Roadmap  
- [ ] Add mixed precision training (FP16).  
- [ ] Expand quantization to per-channel Conv layers.  
- [ ] Add ONNX import/export for interoperability.  
- [ ] Implement flash-attention kernel in Triton.
